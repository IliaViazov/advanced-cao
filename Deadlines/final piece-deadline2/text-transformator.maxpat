					"text" : "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine that started in late February 2022, more than 300, 0 Russian citizens and residents are estimated to have left Russia by mid-March 2022, at least 500, 0 by the end of August 2022, and an additional 400, 0 by early October, for a total of approximately 900, 0. This number includes economic migrants, conscientious objectors, and some political refugees. There have been at least three waves of Russian emigration In the first wave, immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, journalists, politicians, and tech workers fled. Many sought to evade criminal prosecution for exercising free speech regarding the invasion. In March, President Vladimir Putin introduced prison sentences of up to 15 years for publishing \"fake news\" about Russian military operations. More than 2, 0 people were charged by May 2022 under the laws prohibiting fake information about the military. As of December 2022, more than 4, 0 people were prosecuted under \"fake news\" laws in connection with the war in Ukraine. A second wave became apparent by July 2022, and this wave consisted more generally of middle and upper class people and parents who had required longer to prepare to emigrate, for example;\rpeople with businesses or people who had to wait for their children's school year to end. Following Putin's announcement of partial mobilization on 21 September 2022, a third wave of Russian emigration began, with estimates of hundreds of thousands of male citizens fleeing. In the first week after the announcement, 98, 0 Russians fled to Kazakhstan. On 24 September alone over 8, 500 Russians entered Finland by land, a 62% increase on the previous Saturday. On the following day, it was reported that \"On the border with Georgia, queues of Russian cars stretch back more than 30 kilometers,\" while at checkpoints bordering the regions of Kostanay and Western Kazakhstan, \"footage of cars queuing to leave Russia show lines that stretch as far as the eye can see.\" In this third wave alone, nearly 300, 0 Russian citizens had left Russia before 27 September, with that number approaching 400, 0 by 4 October. An upper estimate is for 700, 0 Russians to have fled conscription since it was announced. Many went to Kazakhstan, Serbia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Georgia, Armenia and Finland. Other major destinations include Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Spain, Israel, Tajikistan, Mongolia, Latin American countries, the Baltic states, Canada and the United States. On 16 March, President Vladimir Putin issued a warning to Russian traitors, claiming that the West \"wanted to use them as a fifth column\" and that Russians would always be able to \"distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors.\" While some experts said Putin's ire was directed toward what he perceived to be wavering loyalty among Russian elites, and in particular, Russian oligarchs, statements from Kremlin officials have also broadly labeled those who fled as traitors, as spokesman Dmitry Peskov affirmed the following day to Reuters: \"In such difficult times…Many people show their true colors…They vanish from our lives themselves. Some people are leaving their posts. Some are leaving their active work life. Some leave the country and move to other countries. That is how this cleansing happens.\" On 4 November 2022, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, called the Russians who fled Russia after the invasion \"cowardly traitors\" and said that Russia was \"stronger and cleaner\" without them. On 28 December 2022, he said that Russians who fled Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and are opposed to the war should be labeled \"enemies of society\" and barred from returning to Russia. Medvedev called for the use of death squads against politically active Russian exiles. In January 2023, Russian lawmaker Yevgeny Popov proposed canceling the passports of Russians who fled abroad after Russia invaded Ukraine. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, called the anti-war Russians in exile scoundrels and wanted the confiscation of their properties in Russia"
